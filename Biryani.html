    <h3>DISCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>Biryani (/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of South Asia. It is made with Indian
        spices, vegetables, rice, and usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, or fish), or in some
        cases without any meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes.
